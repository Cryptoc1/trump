# Trump 
========

Trump is a simple Mac application to helps you win arguments by making dull-witted, bigotted statements that can win over a mass 
majority by manipulating generalized opinions and toying with others rooted idealogies. Just like how Hitler empowered the German 
people by blaming everything on the Jews, you can win any debate with help from Donald Trump himself.
